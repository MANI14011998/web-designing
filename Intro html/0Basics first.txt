##  HTML:
Short for HyperText Markup Language, the authoring language used to create documents on 
the World Wide Web.

HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and 
attributes. The correct structure for an HTML document starts with <HTML><HEAD>(enter here 
what document is about)<BODY> and ends with </BODY></HTML>. All the information you'd like 
to include in your Web page fits in between the <BODY> and </BODY> tags.




##  HTML5:
HTML5 is a W3C specification that defines the fifth major revision of the Hypertext 
Markup Language (HTML).

Other new features in HTML5 include specific functions for embedding graphics, audio, video, 
and interactive documents.  New elements also allow you to define sections of your Web page 
using new tags such as < article > which defines an article, < nav > which defines 
navigation links, < source > which defines media resources, and many others. For example, 
the navigation section of your page would be enclosed in the < nav > tags.
